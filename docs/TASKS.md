# Task board

Each task is sized for one agent session. Rae owns this file's priorities
and acceptance criteria. Agents update only the **Status** line of their
own task (and add follow-up tasks under "Proposed", never directly to the
active list).

Status values: `blocked` · `ready` · `in progress (<branch>)` · `in review (<report folder>)` · `done (<report folder>)`

Agent roles are defined in `.claude/agents/`. Every task ends with a
report (`write-report` skill) and, if code changed, a before/after
`benchmarks/check_goals.py` table.

## Phase 0: infrastructure

### T0. Test suite, synthetic generator, scorecard, report contract
- **Status:** done (2026-10-13, built in-session with Rae; see changelog in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)

---

## Phase 1: data

### T1. Audit the SMARTS training set
- **Agent:** `data-auditor`
- **Status:** blocked (data being copied to external drive)
- **Goal:** know what's in the ~1M-file corpus and what's wrong with it before
  training on it.
- **Done when:** report covers inventory, label sanity, recoverability
  (amplitude vs background noise), gap/baseline coverage, distributions and
  biases, duplicates/blends. checks for patterns in sectors with spuriously 
  large noise. Includes a CSV of files recommended for exclusion
  (corrupt) or flagging (hard-but-valid), each with a reason.

### T2. Build frozen dev sets and holdout
- **Agent:** `dev-set-builder`
- **Status:** blocked (on T1 inventory)
- **Note:** SMARTS periods are uniform in 0.1–180 d, so only ~17% of the corpus
  has P < 30 d (the 1-yr-baseline limit) and ~5.5% has P < 10 d. Random sampling
  would make dev sets mostly unrecoverable long periods. Stratify, and use the
  MAST input-parameter catalog rather than opening FITS headers.
- **Goal:** `datasets/dev_small.csv` (~30–50), `dev_medium.csv` (~1000),
  `holdout.csv` (~2000–5000), stratified by period/SNR/baseline, reproducible
  from `tools/build_dev_sets.py`.
- **Done when:** Rae approves the strata and counts; disjointness test passes;
  baseline scorecard run on dev_small committed to `benchmarks/baselines/`.

### T3. Synthetic-vs-SMARTS realism check
- **Agent:** `data-auditor`
- **Status:** blocked (on T1)
- **Goal:** compare `claude_files/synthetic.py` light curves against real SMARTS
  ones (noise spectra, gap patterns, amplitude distribution, ACF morphology) and
  tune `make_suite` so synthetic results predict dev-set results.
- **Done when:** scorecard per-bin outcomes on synthetic vs dev_small are
  compared side by side; discrepancies explained. `PERIOD` is equatorial and the
  shear can be large (PROJECT_CONTEXT open issue 11): quantify how often
  the spot-latitude periods fall outside REL_TOL of P_eq, and propose a
  correctness criterion for Rae.

## Phase 2: candidate generation and fitting

All Phase 2 tasks use `method-improver`. Until T2 lands, judge on
`--synthetic 200 --seed 0`. After that, judge on dev_small, with dev_medium
for confirmation (ask Rae first).

### T4. Fix `guess_pairwise_histogram` crash (open issue 8)
- **Status:** ready
- **Goal:** return `[]` instead of raising when <2 ACF peaks are found.
- **Done when:** the two strict-xfail entries in `tests/test_guesses.py::KNOWN_FAILURES`
  are removed and the suite passes. A good first task for trying out the agent workflow.

### T5. Short-period recovery (<3 d) (open issue 1)
- **Status:** ready
- **Goal:** improve Stage 1 recall and final correctness in the `<1d` and `1-3d`
  bins. Separate the Nyquist/points-per-cycle wall (unfixable) from search
  failures (fixable).
- **Done when:** goals G2/G3 in `benchmarks/goals.json` pass with no regression guard
  tripped.

### T6. Long-period recovery and honest failure (>10 d)
- **Status:** ready
- **Goal:** understand final-answer failures at long P: how many are the
  baseline limit (<4 ACF peaks in 1/3 baseline) versus fixable. Consider whether
  the 1/3-baseline ACF lag cap or `min_peaks_required=4` should adapt.
  **Also:** the Phase 0 baseline found low-SNR (1–3) long-period stars where the
  pipeline confidently reports a ~0.2–0.5 d period instead of declining (7/200
  stars). Find out why those candidates pass the reliability gates.
- **Done when:** a report with a failure taxonomy; a code change only if
  justified; G6 (wrong rate) improves and G1 is not regressed.

### T7. Per-method audits (one session per method)
- **Status:** ready
- **Goal:** for each of `lombscargle`, `acf_fft`, `acf_fft_highpass`, `wavelet`,
  diagnose its failure modes per period bin and propose or implement one
  improvement each.
- **Done when:** one report per method.

### T8. TESS orbit-gap aliasing check (open issue 7). Low priority
- **Agent:** `method-improver` (diagnostic; a code change only if a problem is found)
- **Status:** ready, low priority (Rae, 2026-10-13)
- **Background:** gaps multiply the light curve by a window function, so periodic
  gaps (period T_gap) put spurious peaks at f_rot ± k/T_gap. FFT-based methods
  (`acf_fft*`, the masked-FFT ACF, `wavelet` via interpolation) are the most exposed;
  Lomb-Scargle the least. Earlier checks found real SMARTS/TESS gaps irregular
  enough to be low-risk overall, but the ~1 d gap every ~13.7 d TESS orbit *is*
  periodic and sits inside our 1–30 d period range.
- **Scope (TESS orbit gaps only):**
  1. Sweep rotation period densely around T_gap = 13.7 d and its simple ratios
     (6.85, 27.4 d, …) on synthetic light curves with the standard orbit-gap grid.
  2. For each method and for the final answer, measure success rate and whether
     candidates or answers land on the predicted alias periods
     1/|1/P_rot ± k/T_gap|.
  3. Show the window function's spectrum and ACF for reference.
- **Done when:** a short report says whether stars near 13.7 d (and its ratios)
  show a measurable dip in success or excess aliases relative to neighbouring
  periods, per method, with a recommendation (no action, or a targeted fix).
- **Out of scope for now:** ground-based day/night cadence, momentum-dump gaps, and
  multi-sector yearly clumping. **Re-evaluate if the pipeline is applied to other
  missions (e.g. Roman)**, whose observing windows may be strongly periodic.

### T12. Efficiency pass on the production pipeline
- **Agent:** `performance-optimizer`
- **Status:** ready (synthetic is enough; re-check on dev_small once T2 lands)
- **Why:** at ~1.16 s/star on the default path (`ss_local`, 2026-10-13), one pass over
  1M stars is ~322 CPU-hours (~32 h on 10 workers), and the corpus will be
  re-run many times. Each 10% speedup saves ~32 CPU-hours per pass.
- **Goal:** profile the production path (load → ACF → default guesses → comb fit →
  features), find where time goes (including slow-tail stars), and make it
  faster **without changing results**.
- **Done when:**
  - `benchmarks/profile_pipeline.py` exists;
  - an output-equivalence test exists in `tests/`;
  - optimizations are implemented with before/after timings and no regression
    guard trips;
  - the report includes projected 1M-star CPU-hours and a ranked list of
    further opportunities;
  - any accuracy-for-speed trades are proposed separately for Rae.
- **Coordination:** touches the same files as Phase 2 method work (`guesses.py`,
  `comb_fit.py`). Don't run it concurrently with a method-improver on the same
  module. Rerun after major method changes land, since new methods add cost.
- **Follow-up:** once the profiler exists, Rae may add a runtime goal on its
  output to `goals.json`.

---

## Phase 3: features

### T9. Feature literature and empirical search
- **Agent:** `feature-researcher`
- **Status:** ready (on synthetic); better after T2
- **Goal:** find features that separate correct candidates from P/2 and 2P
  aliases.
- **Done when:** report with a literature table, per-feature separation (AUC)
  by period bin, and any new features implemented, documented and tested.

---

## Phase 4: ranking model

### T10. Feature-table generation at scale
- **Agent:** `ranking-model-builder`
- **Status:** blocked (on T2)
- **Goal:** resumable parallel script producing candidate feature tables for
  dev_medium plus a training sample. Rae runs it locally.
- **Decision needed first:** `extract_candidate_features` labels a candidate 1
  only if its fitted P is within 3% of P_eq. Under differential rotation, a
  correct spot-latitude period gets label 0. Consider a graded relevance label
  for the ranker (2 = P_eq, 1 = in active-band range per
  `evaluation.active_band_period_range`, 0 = otherwise). XGBoost ranking supports this.

### T11. Train and evaluate the ranker
- **Agent:** `ranking-model-builder`
- **Status:** blocked (on T10)
- **Goal:** XGBoost ranker, star-grouped splits, beats hand-tuned arbitration
  per period bin, with a calibrated "decline" threshold.

---

## Future features (Rae-approved direction, not yet scheduled)

### F1. Detect and measure differential rotation
- **Requested by:** Rae, 2026-10-13. Tackle separately from period recovery.
- **Idea:** identify which stars show latitudinal differential rotation and
  estimate how much (e.g. shear, or the spread of spot-latitude periods). SMARTS
  gives exact truth for training and validation (`DIFFROT`, `MINLAT`, `MAXLAT`;
  see `docs/SMARTS_REFERENCE.md`).
- **Possible signals:** period drift across sectors (sliding-window ACF/LS),
  split or broadened periodogram peaks, wavelet ridge wander, comb-fit residual
  structure or per-peak jitter (`allow_jitter` in `comb_fit.py`), and
  multiple non-harmonic candidates clustered within ~0.5–2x P that all fit well.
- **Note:** Claytor+2022's CNN could *not* recover differential rotation from
  binned wavelet spectra, so a positive result would be novel.
- **Prerequisite:** T1/T2 (real data + dev sets). The scorecard's `diffrot`
  outcome already tags stars where we measured a non-equatorial spot period.

## Proposed (agents add here; Rae promotes)

### P1. Quick arbitration improvement before the ML ranker
- **Proposed by:** Phase 0 report (2026-10-13)
- **Idea:** in 10–30 d, Stage-1 recall is 0.95 but final correctness is 0.65.
  Try simple, explainable changes to candidate selection in `fit_rotation_period`
  (e.g. weighting cross-method support `n_contributing_methods`, penalizing
  candidates whose multiples also fit well) and measure them against G4.
